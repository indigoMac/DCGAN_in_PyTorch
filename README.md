## Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Goodfellow et al. in 2014. This project uses a variant called DCGAN, which leverages convolutional layers to generate realistic images.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dcgan.git
cd DCGAN_in_PyTorch
```
2. Run the script:
```bash
python dcgan_commented.py
```
3. To run the project in Google Colab:
- Upload dcgan_commented.py to a Colab notebook.
- Use the code can be seen in the 'google_colab_run.ipynb' file and set up the appropriate directories in your google drive.
- Run the cells to install dependencies and execute the script.

## Model Architecture
### Generator
The generator uses a series of ConvTranspose2d layers to transform a random noise vector into a 64x64 image. Each layer is followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation, except for the final layer which uses Tanh.

### Discriminator
The discriminator is a convolutional network that classifies 64x64 images as real or fake. It uses 'Conv2d' layers with LeakyReLU activations and batch normalization, except for the final layer which uses Sigmoid.

## Results

The model generates images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This is the input sample images:
